    client->>server: POST https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/new_note_spa [{"content": "Messi = Pecho Frio", "date": "2024-1-1"}]
    Note over server: Create new note in data.json

    Note right of client: The client executes the callback function that renders only the new note. I mean it doesn't render all the notes, only newly created ones.
